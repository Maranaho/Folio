      <p class="demi">Hi everyone, my name is Maranaho, Iâ€™m 33 I come from the beautiful region of Brittany in France and I live in in the great city of London.
      <br/>I am an <strong>Art graduate</strong> with ES6 Vanilla <strong>JavaScript programming</strong> skills which basically makes me a Ninja / Unicorn.
      <br/>Also back in 2016 I was a <strong>Frontend development teacher</strong> for product design students in an Art school in France.</p>
      <p class="demi">I had the best time and <strong>I really miss teaching</strong> so this is a public announcement: I will chase any opportunity to teach again especially to designers!</p>
